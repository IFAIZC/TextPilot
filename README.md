Problem:
At Decathlon MyTown, we often had to send out WhatsApp messages in the same format repeatedly. With multiple teammates using a shared WhatsApp number, this led to frequent miscommunication and inconsistencies.

Solution:
I built textPilot, a simple but effective Chrome Extension to solve that. With just a click, my teammates could launch the extension, copy a pre-written message template, and quickly personalize it with the customer’s name and relevant details. It made our communication faster, clearer, and more consistent.

Even though it was a scrappy build, it was one of my first JavaScript Chrome Extensions, developed with care and purpose. It solved a real problem at my workplace and made our daily work smoother and that’s what made it special.
